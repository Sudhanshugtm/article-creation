- **Timeline:** 6-month roadmap with immediate, short-term, and medium-term goals
- **Resource Focus:** 60 critical features, 30 high priority, 10 strategic exploration
- **Success Metrics:** Real-time abandonment monitoring and community adoption

**Implementation Phases:**
1. **Critical Priority (Weeks 1-4):** Community integration and lifecycle management
2. **High Priority (Weeks 5-8):** Mobile optimization and AfC integration
3. **Medium Priority (Weeks 9-16):** AI enhancement and advanced features
4. **Strategic Priority (Weeks 17-24):** Multi-language support and ecosystem integration

**Expected Outcomes:**
- **65-75 overall abandonment reduction** through systematic improvements
- **Community adoption** with 40+ articles receiving engagement
- **Mobile success** with <75% abandonment rate (from 89%)

**Lifecycle Management (65 Abandon After First Decline):**
- **No draft monitoring** system for tracking progress
- **No abandonment prediction** or risk assessment
- **No post-decline support** for improvement guidance
- **No intervention triggers** for at-risk editors

### Impact Analysis

**Current Effectiveness:** 20% of abandonment problem solved
