## Phase 1: Research Design and Planning

### Step 1: Define Research Questions

**Primary Questions (Choose 1-2):**
- What types of new editors seek help at Wikipedia support venues?
- What evidence-based categories can be identified from help-seeking behavior?
- How do community responses vary by editor type?
- What behavioral patterns predict editor success or abandonment?

**Secondary Questions (Optional):**
- What proportion of help requests can be categorized with confidence?
- What community response patterns are most effective?
- What limitations exist in current categorization approaches?

**Question Quality Criteria:**
- **Specific and answerable** with available data
- **Relevant to community** improvement goals
- **Achievable with resources** and timeline
- **Ethical and appropriate** for community research

### Step 2: Establish Research Standards

**Evidence Quality Standards:**
```
TIER 1 (HIGH CONFIDENCE):
- Direct quotes with explicit self-identification
- Clear behavioral indicators
- Unambiguous language patterns
- Documented community responses

TIER 2 (MEDIUM CONFIDENCE):
- Consistent behavioral patterns
- Multiple supporting indicators
- Community consensus about type
- Cross-reference with known patterns

TIER 3 (LOW CONFIDENCE):
- Circumstantial indicators only
- Single supporting indicators
- Community suspicions without proof
- Interpretive categorization

TIER 4 (INSUFFICIENT):
- Speculation without support
- Contradictory indicators
- Insufficient data for confidence
- Unverifiable claims
```

**Confidence Thresholds:**
- **High Confidence:** Tier 1 evidence required
- **Medium Confidence:** Tier 2 evidence minimum (use sparingly)
- **Low Confidence:** Tier 3 evidence, clearly marked as uncertain
- **No Categorization:** Tier 4 evidence, acknowledge insufficient data

### Step 3: Data Collection Planning

**Source Selection:**
- **Primary Sources:** Wikipedia Teahouse current page and recent archives
- **Secondary Sources:** Help Desk, Reference Desk, relevant WikiProjects
- **Validation Sources:** Cross-reference with other language Wikipedias
- **Excluded Sources:** Private communications, deleted content, personal pages

**Sampling Strategy:**
- **Systematic sampling:** Every nth discussion thread for consistency
- **Stratified sampling:** Ensure representation across time periods
- **Purposive sampling:** Include diverse question types and difficulty levels
- **Document exclusions:** Note any cases excluded and provide rationale

**Sample Size Targets:**
- **Minimum viable sample:** 100 cases for initial pattern identification
- **Statistical significance:** 500+ cases for reliable percentage estimates
- **Confidence intervals:** Calculate margin of error for all estimates
- **Power analysis:** Determine required sample size for hypothesis testing

**Data Collection Protocol:**
```
For each discussion thread:
1. Record metadata (date, title, responses, resolution)
2. Extract editor information (username, experience level)
3. Collect question content (full text, context, problems)
4. Document community responses (guidance, tone, outcome)
5. Assess evidence quality (assign tier level)
```

## Phase 3: Categorization Process

### Step 6: Inductive Category Development

**Initial Pattern Identification:**

**1. Open Reading (50 cases minimum):**
- Read through cases without predetermined categories
- Take notes on recurring themes and patterns
- Identify specific examples of each pattern observed
- Avoid forcing data into preconceived categories

**2. Pattern Documentation:**
- Create preliminary pattern descriptions
- Collect supporting examples for each pattern
- Note frequency of occurrence for each pattern
- Identify potential category boundaries

**3. Preliminary Grouping:**
- Group similar patterns together
- Define initial category boundaries
- Test categories against additional cases
- Refine definitions based on testing

**Category Documentation Template:**
```
Category Name: [Descriptive name]
Definition: [Clear, operationalized definition]
Evidence Tier: [1-4 based on quality]
Confidence Level: [High/Medium/Low]

Direct Evidence Examples:
- Quote 1: "[exact quote]" (Source: [identifier])
- Quote 2: "[exact quote]" (Source: [identifier])
- Quote 3: "[exact quote]" (Source: [identifier])

Behavioral Indicators:
- [Specific observable behaviors]
- [Language patterns]
- [Question types]
- [Response patterns]

- Have each coder categorize cases independently
- No discussion until all coding is complete
- Calculate Cohen's kappa for each pair of coders
- Document disagreements and reasoning

**3. Acceptable Reliability Thresholds:**
- **κ ≥ 0.7:** Acceptable agreement (minimum standard)
- **κ ≥ 0.8:** Good agreement (preferred standard)
- **κ ≥ 0.9:** Excellent agreement (ideal standard)

**4. Disagreement Resolution:**
- Review all disagreements systematically
- Identify sources of confusion in category definitions
- Refine category criteria based on disagreements
- Conduct additional training if needed
- Re-test reliability with refined categories

**Category Refinement Process:**
- **Analyze disagreement patterns:** Common sources of confusion
- **Clarify boundary conditions:** Better definitions of edge cases
- **Combine similar categories:** Merge categories with unclear boundaries
- **Split broad categories:** Divide categories that are too heterogeneous
- **Test refined categories:** Validate improvements with new data

## Common Implementation Challenges

### Challenge 1: Ambiguous Cases

**Problem:** Some editors don't fit neatly into any category or seem to belong to multiple categories.

**Solutions:**
- **Create mixed categories:** "Multiple motivations" or "Unclear motivation"
- **Document ambiguity:** Explicitly note cases that are difficult to classify
- **Use probability assignments:** Assign likelihood of belonging to each category
- **Report uncategorized percentage:** Acknowledge what cannot be determined

**Implementation:**
```
Ambiguous Case Protocol:
1. Attempt categorization using standard criteria
2. If unclear, note specific sources of ambiguity
3. Consider multiple category membership
4. Document decision-making process
5. Include in "unclear" category if necessary
```

### Challenge 2: Researcher Bias

**Problem:** Preconceptions and expectations influence categorization decisions.

**Solutions:**
- **Use multiple independent coders:** Reduce impact of individual bias
- **Implement blind analysis:** Analyze data without knowing expected outcomes
- **Actively seek contradictory evidence:** Look for cases that challenge hypotheses
- **Document all decisions:** Maintain transparency about reasoning

**Bias Mitigation Strategies:**
- **Predetermined criteria:** Establish categories before applying to data
- **Systematic procedures:** Use consistent methods for all cases
- **Peer review:** Have colleagues evaluate categorization decisions
- **Devil's advocate:** Actively argue against tentative conclusions

### Challenge 3: Small Sample Issues

**Problem:** Some categories have very few cases, making statistical analysis difficult.

**Solutions:**
- **Combine related categories:** Merge similar small categories when appropriate
- **Report limitations explicitly:** Acknowledge small sample constraints
- **Use appropriate statistics:** Confidence intervals that reflect uncertainty
- **Avoid overinterpretation:** Don't make strong claims from small samples

**Small Sample Protocols:**
- **Minimum thresholds:** Require at least 10 cases for stable categories
- **Confidence intervals:** Always report uncertainty bounds
- **Descriptive focus:** Emphasize description over statistical testing
- **Replication needs:** Suggest validation with larger samples

### Challenge 4: Temporal Variations

**Problem:** Patterns may change over time, affecting consistency of findings.

**Solutions:**
- **Temporal analysis:** Compare patterns across different time periods
- **Seasonal consideration:** Account for predictable variations (academic calendar)
- **Trend analysis:** Look for systematic changes over time
- **Limitation acknowledgment:** Note time-specific nature of findings

**Temporal Validation:**
- **Multi-period sampling:** Include data from different time periods
- **Consistency testing:** Check whether patterns remain stable
- **Change documentation:** Note any systematic changes observed
- **Contextual factors:** Consider external factors affecting patterns
