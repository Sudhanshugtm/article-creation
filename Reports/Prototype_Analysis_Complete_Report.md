### The Top 4 Categories of New Editor Problems

#### 1. Sourcing & Notability Issues (40 of Problems)

**Problem Definition:**
New editors consistently struggle with understanding reliable sources and meeting Wikipedia's notability standards, representing the single largest category of abandonment triggers.

**Common Failure Scenarios:**

*Unreliable Source Usage:*
- **IMDb, YouTube, social media** cited as primary sources
- **Blog posts and personal websites** used for biographical information
- **Self-published sources** mistaken for reliable sources
- **Commercial databases** treated as independent sources

*Notability Confusion:*
- **Misunderstanding "significant coverage"** requirement
- **Confusion between general and subject-specific guidelines**
- **Repeated draft rejections** (documented case: Draft:Daxflame declined 5 times)
- **Misapplication of academic standards** (WP:ACADEMIC confusion)

**Direct Evidence from New Editors:**
> *"I am a student who has been given an assignment to make a substantial edit to a Wikipedia article. My edit was immediately deleted, which I assume means I made a mistake"*

> *"I used IMDb as a source because it has all the information about this actor"*

> *"I don't understand why my professor isn't notable - he has published papers and won awards"*

**Community Response Patterns:**
- **"What's needed is reliable sources"** (most common advice)
- **Policy link provision** to WP:RS, WP:V, WP:NOTABILITY
- **Specific examples** of acceptable vs. unacceptable sources
- **Independent coverage explanations** and requirements

**Abandonment Impact:**
- **Primary trigger** for immediate abandonment after first rejection
- **85 abandonment rate** following notability declines
- **Emotional devastation** when work is rejected for sourcing issues
- **Cycle of revision and re-rejection** without understanding

#### 2. Conflict of Interest Issues (25 of Problems)

**Problem Definition:**
New editors frequently attempt to write about subjects they have personal, professional, or financial connections to, often without understanding COI policies.

**Common Scenarios:**

*Personal Connections:*
- **Deceased family members** (emotionally charged situations)
- **Spouses, relatives, close friends** article creation
