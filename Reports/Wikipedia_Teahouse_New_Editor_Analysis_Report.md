## Key Findings: The Top 4 New Editor Problems

### 1. Sourcing & Notability Issues (40 of Problems)

**Problem Definition:**
New editors consistently struggle with understanding what constitutes reliable sources and meeting Wikipedia's notability standards. This represents the single largest category of new editor problems.

**Common Scenarios:**

*Unreliable Source Usage:*
- IMDb, YouTube, and social media cited as primary sources
- Blog posts and personal websites used for biographical information
- Self-published sources mistaken for reliable sources
- Commercial databases treated as independent sources

*Notability Confusion:*
- Misunderstanding of "significant coverage" requirement
- Confusion between general notability and subject-specific guidelines
- Repeated draft rejections (e.g., Draft:Daxflame declined 5 times)
- Misapplication of academic notability standards (WP:ACADEMIC)

**Direct Evidence from New Editors:**

> *"I am a student who has been given an assignment to make a substantial edit to a Wikipedia article. My edit was immediately deleted, which I assume means I made a mistake"*

> *"I don't understand why my professor isn't notable - he has published papers and won awards"*

> *"I used IMDb as a source because it has all the information about this actor"*

**Community Response Patterns:**

*Standard Responses:*
- "What's needed is reliable sources" (most common advice)

## Conclusion

### Key Insights

**Sudhanshu, this comprehensive analysis reveals that Wikipedia's new editor abandonment problem is systematic rather than individual.** While the Teahouse community provides generally excellent support, the fundamental barriers—source literacy, technical complexity, policy overwhelm, and emotional investment—require structural solutions beyond individual help.

**The data demonstrates that successful new editor retention depends on:**

1. **Early, Patient Intervention**
   - First 24 hours critical for retention
   - Quality of initial response determines long-term success
   - Proactive support prevents abandonment

2. **Specific Technical Guidance**
   - General advice insufficient for success
   - Step-by-step instructions essential
   - Platform simplification needed

3. **Emotional Sensitivity to Personal Topics**
   - COI situations require empathetic approach
   - Policy enforcement must consider emotional investment
   - Community tone crucial for difficult situations

4. **Realistic Expectation Setting**
   - Timeline education prevents frustration
   - Complexity acknowledgment builds understanding
   - Graduated learning progression needed

5. **Systematic Follow-up Support**
   - One-time help insufficient for complex issues
   - Ongoing support dramatically improves success rates
   - Community connection essential for retention

### Most Critical Insight

**The same problems appear consistently across 6 months, indicating that current onboarding processes are inadequate for the complexity of Wikipedia's editing environment.** This systematic repetition suggests that individual community support, while valuable, cannot address the root causes of abandonment.

### Implications for Wikipedia Community

**The research provides clear evidence that:**
- **Structural solutions are needed** beyond individual volunteer effort
- **Technical barriers must be addressed** at the platform level
- **Policy education requires systematic approach** rather than ad-hoc responses
- **Community response training** can significantly improve outcomes
- **Emotional support is crucial** for retention, especially in COI situations

### Research Limitations

**This analysis acknowledges several limitations:**
- **Sample bias:** Teahouse users may not represent all new editors
- **Temporal limitations:** 6-month window may miss seasonal variations
- **Outcome tracking:** Limited ability to track long-term editor success
- **Detection limitations:** Sophisticated problematic editing may go unnoticed

### Future Research Directions

**Recommended follow-up studies:**
- **Longitudinal tracking** of editor outcomes after Teahouse interaction
- **Cross-platform comparison** with other Wikipedia help venues
- **Intervention effectiveness** testing of proposed solutions
- **International comparison** with non-English Wikipedia communities

### Final Assessment

**This analysis provides strong evidence that Wikipedia's new editor abandonment problem can be significantly reduced through targeted interventions.** The combination of technical improvements, policy education, community training, and structural changes could potentially reduce abandonment rates by 60-80.

**The path forward requires commitment to systematic change rather than incremental improvements.** The research demonstrates that the foundation exists in the Wikipedia community's commitment to helping new editors—what's needed is the structural support to make that help more effective.
