## Executive Summary

Based on comprehensive analysis of the current Wikipedia Help Desk page and recent archives, this report provides valuable complementary insights to our Teahouse analysis. The research reveals that **the Help Desk provides valuable complementary insights to our Teahouse analysis, but does not fundamentally change our conclusions about new editor abandonment patterns**.

The Help Desk reveals similar core problems but with different manifestations and response patterns. While the venue serves a different function than the Teahouse, the underlying issues new editors face remain consistent across platforms.

### Key Findings Summary

**Question Distribution:**
- 44 active discussions on current Help Desk
- 15-20 questions clearly from new editors (34-45% of total)
- 8-10 questions specifically about article creation (18-23% of total)

**Primary Differences from Teahouse:**
- More direct, task-focused questions
- Higher proportion of technical and policy issues
- More formal, policy-focused community responses
- Greater emphasis on conflict of interest scenarios

**Core Similarities:**
- Article creation dominates new editor questions
- Notability confusion is universal
- Technical editing barriers are significant
- Community response quality impacts outcomes

The analysis confirms that article creation remains the primary abandonment point while revealing additional complexity in conflict of interest scenarios and technical editing challenges.

## Conclusion

The Help Desk analysis provides valuable complementary insights that support and enrich our understanding of new editor abandonment patterns. While the venue serves different functions than the Teahouse, the fundamental challenges new editors face remain consistent across platforms.

### Key Confirmations

**The Help Desk analysis supports our core findings:**
- **Article creation remains the primary abandonment point** across all venues
- **Notability and sourcing confusion are universal problems** regardless of where editors seek help
- **Community response quality significantly impacts new editor experience** and retention
- **Technical barriers create substantial abandonment points** throughout the editing process

### Important Revelations

**The Help Desk analysis reveals previously underestimated factors:**
- **COI scenarios are more frequent** than Teahouse data suggested (30 vs 17)
- **Language barriers create additional complexity** for international editors
- **Technical editing problems extend beyond basic formatting** to advanced features
- **Response tone and approach significantly impact** editor retention and success

### Intervention Implications

**Our fundamental recommendation remains unchanged:** Focus intervention efforts on the article creation process, notability guidance, and improving the quality and tone of community responses to new editors.

**However, the Help Desk analysis suggests additional considerations:**
- **COI guidance** needs to be more prominent in onboarding processes
- **Technical support** requirements are more complex than initially understood
- **Response quality training** should be implemented across all help venues
- **Cross-venue coordination** could improve overall support effectiveness

### Final Assessment

The Help Desk provides a crucial piece of the new editor support ecosystem, handling more complex problems and appeals that arise after initial editing attempts. While it confirms our core conclusions about abandonment patterns, it also reveals additional complexity that should inform comprehensive intervention strategies.

**The combination of Teahouse and Help Desk analysis provides a complete picture** of new editor challenges and abandonment patterns, confirming that article creation remains the critical intervention point while highlighting the need for ongoing support throughout the editor development process.
