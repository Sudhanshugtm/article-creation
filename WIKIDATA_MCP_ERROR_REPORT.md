# Wikidata MCP Error Report

## Summary
This document catalogues all errors encountered during development of the smart template generation system, providing specific details to assist developers in debugging and fixing the Wikidata MCP server.

## Context
While developing the intelligent template generation system for article creation, multiple attempts were made to use Wikidata MCP tools for pattern analysis and Wikipedia content extraction. All attempts resulted in various error conditions that prevented successful implementation.

## Encountered Errors

### 1. Featured Article Analysis Errors

#### Error Type: SPARQL Query Execution Failures
**Tools Affected:** `wikidata_sparql_query`, `wikidata_sparql_template`
**Attempted Use Case:** Finding featured articles by category for pattern analysis

**Error Symptoms:**
- SPARQL queries for featured articles fail to execute
- Template queries for finding instances of categories return empty results
- No successful completion of queries to find Wikipedia's highest quality articles

**Expected Behavior:**
- Should return list of featured/good articles for categories like Person, Location, Species
- Should enable analysis of lead section patterns from exemplary Wikipedia content

### 2. Wikipedia Lead Section Extraction Errors

#### Error Type: Wikipedia Content Retrieval Failures  
**Tools Affected:** `wikidata_get_wikipedia_lead`, `wikidata_get_wikipedia_articles`
**Attempted Use Case:** Extracting lead sections from featured articles for pattern analysis

**Error Symptoms:**
- Unable to retrieve Wikipedia lead sections for analysis
- Wikipedia article content extraction fails
- No successful pattern extraction from real Wikipedia content

**Expected Behavior:**
- Should extract lead sections from specified Wikipedia articles
- Should enable analysis of sentence structures and information hierarchy
- Should provide source material for template pattern development

### 3. Pattern Analysis Tool Errors

#### Error Type: Class Pattern Analysis Failures
**Tools Affected:** `wikidata_analyze_class_patterns`, `wikidata_get_property_values`
**Attempted Use Case:** Analyzing common properties and patterns across article categories

**Error Symptoms:**
- Unable to analyze property frequency patterns across categories
- Property value extraction fails for entities
- No successful pattern discovery from Wikidata entity collections

**Expected Behavior:**
- Should identify which properties appear in 70%+ of category articles
- Should enable discovery of category-specific information patterns
- Should provide data for intelligent chip generation

### 4. Entity Resolution Errors

#### Error Type: Entity Name Resolution Failures
**Tools Affected:** `wikidata_get_entity`, `wikidata_search_entities`
**Attempted Use Case:** Resolving entity IDs to human-readable names in templates

**Error Symptoms:**
- Entity ID to name resolution intermittently fails
- Search functionality produces inconsistent results
- Template generation fails due to unresolved entity references

**Expected Behavior:**
- Should consistently resolve Wikidata entity IDs (Q-numbers) to readable names
- Should provide reliable search functionality for entity discovery
- Should enable seamless template population with resolved names

### 5. Subclass and Instance Errors

#### Error Type: Hierarchical Relationship Failures
**Tools Affected:** `wikidata_get_subclasses`, `wikidata_get_instances`
**Attempted Use Case:** Understanding category hierarchies for context-aware template selection

**Error Symptoms:**
- Subclass relationship queries fail
- Instance discovery for categories returns incomplete results
- Unable to build hierarchical understanding of topics

**Expected Behavior:**
- Should return complete subclass hierarchies for analysis
- Should identify all instances of a given class/category
- Should enable intelligent subcategory detection

## Impact on Development

### Blocked Features
1. **Smart Template Generation**: Cannot analyze Wikipedia patterns to create intelligent templates
2. **Context-Aware Chips**: Cannot determine appropriate chips based on category analysis
3. **Quality Validation**: Cannot compare generated templates against Wikipedia standards
4. **Pattern Discovery**: Cannot extract common structural patterns from featured articles

### Current Workarounds
1. **Static Templates**: Using hardcoded template structures instead of pattern-derived ones
2. **Generic Chips**: Using one-size-fits-all chips instead of contextual ones
3. **Manual Curation**: Relying on manual template design rather than data-driven analysis
4. **Limited Intelligence**: Templates lack the sophistication that would come from real pattern analysis

## Required Fixes

### Priority 1: Core Query Functionality
- Fix SPARQL query execution for featured article discovery
- Ensure Wikipedia content extraction works reliably
- Resolve entity ID to name resolution issues

### Priority 2: Pattern Analysis Tools
- Enable property frequency analysis across categories
- Fix class pattern analysis functionality
- Ensure hierarchical relationship queries work correctly

### Priority 3: Consistency and Reliability
- Implement consistent error handling across all tools
- Ensure reproducible results from identical queries
- Provide meaningful error messages for debugging

## Testing Recommendations

### Test Cases for Validation
1. **Featured Article Query**: Find 10 featured biographies using SPARQL
2. **Lead Section Extraction**: Extract lead sections from those 10 articles
3. **Pattern Analysis**: Analyze property patterns across Person category
4. **Entity Resolution**: Resolve 100 random entity IDs to names
5. **Hierarchical Queries**: Get subclasses and instances for major categories

### Success Criteria
- All tools execute without errors
- Results are consistent across multiple runs
- Error messages are informative when legitimate errors occur
- Performance is acceptable for interactive use

## Development Notes

### Alternative Approaches Considered
While waiting for MCP fixes, considered these alternatives:
1. **Direct Wikipedia API**: Too complex for pattern analysis needs
2. **Static Analysis**: Lacks the intelligence that Wikidata provides
3. **Manual Curation**: Not scalable across all categories
4. **Simplified Templates**: Reduces quality and user experience

### Post-Fix Implementation Plan
Once MCP tools are working:
1. Implement featured article analysis pipeline
2. Create pattern extraction algorithms
3. Build intelligent template generation system
4. Validate against real Wikipedia content
5. Deploy enhanced template system

## Conclusion

The Wikidata MCP errors have significantly impacted the development of intelligent template generation features. Resolving these issues will unlock the ability to create truly smart, context-aware templates that reflect Wikipedia's editorial standards and practices.

**Next Steps:** MCP developers should prioritize fixing the core query and content extraction functionality to enable the advanced template generation system described in SMART_TEMPLATE_GENERATION_PLAN.md.
