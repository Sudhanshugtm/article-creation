 * Composable for detecting the language of the context surrounding a component.
 * For example, if the component is wrapped in <div lang="ar">...</div>, this composable
 * detects that and returns 'ar'.
 *
 * The value returned by this composable will initially be null, and will then
 * update to the detected language later, when the component mounts. This is
 * because detecting the language is not possible until the component has been
 * mounted. Code using this composable should anticipate this, and check whether
 * the value is null.
 *
 * @param root Template ref for the root element of the component
 * @return The detected language code, or null if the component hasn't been mounted yet.
